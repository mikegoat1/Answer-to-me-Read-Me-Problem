# Auto Markdown Generator <img src=https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue/>

## Description

  I created this app in order to fix a huge problem I usually have. Thats making README's for my projects. I have never been good at this portion of my projects, so I created a little aid. I hope to make this project in the future include a bit more parameters.
